**Welcome to the FullY AutO - Auto Farm test branch!** This is where all of my code from my local pc will be placed. It's essentially a backup because I like to format my SSD to get a feel of different operating systems. This branch is always unstable and will have a bunch of unnecessary dependencies. Anyways if you want to see a early version of any technology or the autofarm itself, it will be under here.

# Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. **Forking, Using, or Copying:**  
   This is open-source, so you are free to use either the [technologies]() or the full [autofarm script](). However, you **MUST** give credit to me as a contributor and <ins> **you cannot use anything in this branch that is not on the main branch for comerial use**</ins>. Example: *"Credits to Zynic" [[link to repository]]()*.

2. **Code Stability:**  
   This branch will remain up to date, but the code is very **unstable** and most likely will not work in without specific usecase knowledge. All code here will be made for the purpose of using <img width="18" height="16" src="Pics/favicon.png">[*Swift*](https://getswift.xyz/) as your executor but, this branch will contain general code that can be used on all executors except for; <br>
  <ins>
   - **UNC-SPOOFED EXECUTORS!**  
   - **Executors wit less than 50% sUNC** [basically executors without basic functions]
   </ins>.
